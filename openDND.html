        As it currently stands, the state of Dungeons and Dragons and many other
        Tabletop RPGs are under threat of becoming harshly monopolized and
        monotized by the owners of said product. Wizards of the Coast has
        recently put forward potential changes to be made to the franchise that
        would do exactly that do every Tabletop RPG that the Open Game License
        supports, the License is also often refered to as the OGL. This problem
        alone would cause Dungeons and Dragons to lose aspect of it's amazing
        community as most supporters would leave the industry, either moving to
        another system or departing from TTRPGs entirely. Dungeons and Dragons
        and many other Tabletop Role-playing Games are able to be the way that
        they are because this license.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the Open Gaming License?</h3>

      <p class="content">
        The Open Gaming License (OGL) is a legal framework that allows creators
        to use the rules and ideas of roleplaying games in their own works.
        Initially released in 2000 by Wizards of the Coast, it has become a
        pillar of the tabletop gaming industry, fueling the popularity and
        accessibility of games such as Pathfinder, 13th Age, and Dungeons and
        Dragons 5th Edition. The OGL has done more to foster creativity and
        innovation in the tabletop gaming ecosystem than any other element. By
        allowing creators to use and collaboratively build upon the core
        mechanics and concepts of existing games, the OGL has created a wide
        variety of new games and game products, ranging from minor independent
        releases to large, commercially successful titles.
      </p>

      <h3>End of an Open Era</h3>

      <p class="content">
        However, Wizards of the Coast (WotC) has announced an updated OGL
        (version 1.1)—an attempt to dismantle the entire RPG industry. This new
        license intends to completely revoke the old OGL, a perpetual license
        designed by WotC themselves to be irrevocable. Nothing about this new
        license is “open.” It chokes the vibrant community that has flourished
        under the original license. No matter the creator, it locks everyone
        into a new contract that restricts their work, makes it mandatory to
        report their projects and revenues to Wizards of the Coast, and gives
        WotC the legal right to reproduce and resell creators' content without
        permission or compensation. The new license can also be modified with
        worse terms or terminated at any time without any recompense by
        creators. For the largest creators in the industry, WotC is imposing an
        impossible tax of 25%—based on their total sales above $750K, not
        profit. This is anti-competitive, monopolistic behavior designed to
        crush small businesses that collectively employ hundreds of designers,
        writers, and artists. Under this tax, it becomes impossible for creators
        to put books on game stores' shelves or run Kickstarters for large
        audiences. Even though this only affects some companies in the space,
        those targeted are still tiny compared to Wizards of the Coast, which
        made $1.3 billion in 2021. On top of that, games such as Pathfinder 1E
        and 2E, 13th Age, Fudge, and Traveller—which use the 1.0 OGL as the
        backbone of their existence—will need to cease sales of upcoming
        products or give WotC 25% of their revenue to stay in compliance with
        the new license. Furthermore, under the new license, virtual tabletops
        (VTTs) cannot operate. They can no longer support OGL systems, and
        creators can no longer release modules and adventures on popular digital
        platforms such as Foundry, Alchemy, or Shard. If this new license gains
        wide adoption, the tabletop landscape will fracture and lose its biggest
        onboarding mechanisms, shuttering the small businesses that populate
        your local cons and putting a stop to their creations. Innovation in the
        gaming industry will evaporate; your favorite games will be trapped in
        the past, instead of being allowed to migrate to your phone, virtual
        reality, and beyond. Diversity in the industry will shrink away, as
        projects from marginalized creators are effectively written out of the
        future. We expect Wizards of the Coast to attempt expensive and illegal
        lawsuits to enforce compliance with their new agreement. Even if they
        aren't successful in court, they will irrevocably damage the tabletop
        industry.
      </p>

      <h3>#OpenDnD</h3>
      <p class="content">
        #OpenDnD is a rallying cry under which creators and fans have unified to
        demand that WotC revoke the draconian 1.1 OGL and pledge to support the
        existing 1.0 OGL into future editions of their games. This isn't an
        opportunity to litigate and tinker with a new license, but to return to
        the values of open gaming. Our community deserves an open future if we
        want our favorite games to not only survive, but thrive!! If you are a
        creator, #DontSign the new agreement. If you love roleplaying games, let
        WotC know we won't support them without an #OpenDnD! WotC has shown that
        they are the dragon on top of the hoard, willing to burn the thriving
        village if only to get a few more gold pieces. It's time for us to band
        together as adventurers to defend our village from the terrible wyrm.
